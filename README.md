# Real Estate Data Analysis

## Overview
This Python script analyzes real estate transaction data for the year 2022. It focuses on cleaning, processing, and analyzing the data to extract meaningful insights.

## Libraries Used
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: For plotting graphs.
- `seaborn`: For advanced data visualization.
- `sklearn`: For machine learning and data preprocessing.

## Data Loading and Preprocessing
1. **Load Data**: The data is loaded from a CSV file using `pandas.read_csv` with a predefined data type dictionary (`dtype_dict`) for proper type casting.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Drop rows with missing values in 'longitude' and 'latitude'.
   - Remove duplicate entries.

3. **Data Inspection**: Use `data.info()` to inspect the data structure.

4. **Data Filtering and Transformation**:
   - Filter the data based on specific criteria (e.g., nature of mutation, number of lots, etc.).
   - Replace certain department codes.
   - Drop unnecessary columns.
   - Convert data types and handle missing values.
   - Add new calculated columns (e.g., 'Prix_m').

5. **Outlier Detection and Removal**: Apply custom functions to filter out outliers based on statistical measures.

6. **Data Aggregation**: Use `pivot_table` to summarize data.

7. **Data Segmentation**: Separate data into different categories based on property type and nature of mutation.

## Data Analysis and Visualization
1. **Histogram Creation**: Plot a histogram to visualize the distribution of 'Prix_m'.

2. **Data Sorting**: Sort the data to identify top entries based on specific criteria.

3. **Creating a BallTree Model**: Implement a BallTree model for geospatial data analysis.

4. **Data Exporting**: Save processed data to external files.

5. **Error Analysis**:
   - Predict values using a RandomForestRegressor.
   - Analyze and visualize prediction errors.

6. **Performance Metrics Calculation**: Calculate and display metrics like MSE, MAE, and R2 Score.

7. **Error Analysis (Extended)**:
   - Identify high-error instances.
   - Perform detailed analysis on these instances.
   - Export findings to Excel for further examination.

8. **Graphical Analysis**: Visualize error distributions and other key insights using matplotlib.

## Conclusion
This script offers a comprehensive approach to real estate data analysis, utilizing various data processing techniques and machine learning for insightful analysis.
